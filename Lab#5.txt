# Requirement step 5 - use the columns in_spotify_charts, in_apple_charts, in_deezer_charts, in_shazam_charts,
# output the chart leaders in a nice tabulated table (pretty table) with the headings {Track / Artist /
# Spotify Favorite / Apple Favorite / Deezer Favorite / Shazam Favorite }.  Put the value found from the charts
# column for each artist/track in the column that they are the leader. So, you will have only one (unless it's
# the same artist / track filled in for each chart.)
